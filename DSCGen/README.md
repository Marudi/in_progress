#Desired State Generator

If you are interested in using PowerShell Desired State Configuration to manage your web server configuration, the DSC Generator can help you get started. You can run the DSC Generator on an existing server and it will generate DSC configuration code for your IIS App Pools, Sites, and Virtual Directories.  The DSC Generator will also generate Desired State Configuration for the Windows features your IIS site needs.
